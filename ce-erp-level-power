# 🚀 Compose Entity — ERP-level power in your Jetpack Compose Android app

In a typical Android project, getting from database to UI looks like this:

1. Define your `@Entity`
2. Create a `@Dao`
3. Configure the `@Database`
4. Set up a `Repository`
5. Create a `ViewModel`
6. Connect everything to the Compose UI
7. Handle migrations, DI, errors…

🔧 All that — just to make a simple form for editing a table.

## 💰 What do “big players” offer?

Platforms like **SAP**, **Oracle APEX**, or **Salesforce** (and other low-code/ERP solutions):

- Let you define tables visually or declaratively
- Automatically generate UIs for editing records
- Include built-in business logic features

But:

❌ They lock you into their own ecosystem

❌ Require learning a custom language or DSL

❌ Offer limited UI flexibility

❌ Are often expensive

❌ Don’t run natively on Android

---

## ✨ Enter **Compose Entity**

Compose Entity is like a low-code platform — **but for Android**, fully built with **Kotlin + Jetpack Compose**. It lets you:

✅ Define a table in a single data class

✅ Get a working form with no UI code

✅ Stay in Android Studio, no new tools to learn

✅ Use your custom UI or keep the auto-generated one

✅ Instantly generate CRUD operations

✅ Use Room under the hood

✅ Handle database migrations automatically

## 🧩 But what if I need more than just a table?

In real-world apps you often need:

- **Documents** (orders, invoices, delivery notes)
- **Detail lines** (child records related to a document)
- **Posting logic** — calculations or updates based on document data
- **Movements** — like inventory, balances, or status updates

Compose Entity supports all of that out of the box:

🧾 **Documents with details** — just define the child records, and the form will automatically include them. No adapters, `LazyColumn`, or custom state management.

🔁 **Posting** — automatically generate records in other tables (like registers) when a document is saved.

📊 **Accumulation and Information Registers** — define them just like entities, and the system handles the rest.

All of this, in pure Kotlin.

## 🎯 Perfect for:

- Accounting and ERP systems
- Orders, inventory, finance tracking
- Internal business tools
- CRM apps
- Reporting, document tracking, and registers
- Educational or admin dashboards

## ⚠️ Limitations to keep in mind

Like any tool, Compose Entity isn’t magic — and that’s okay.

- 📦 **Local SQLite only**
    
    Compose Entity uses SQLite under the hood. It’s perfect for apps with local data or moderate complexity — but not built-in for distributed enterprise databases or cloud sync (yet).
    
- 🔄 **No built-in sync**
    
    If you need to synchronize your data with a central server or across devices — you’ll need to implement custom sync logic.
    
- 🌐 **Offline-first by design**
    
    This means you’re free to build online/offline hybrid apps — but Compose Entity doesn’t include a server backend, login/auth system, or real-time features out of the box.

> On the other hand — that’s how communities are born.

And Compose Entity makes that core experience as fun and productive as it gets — right from your first `@Entity`.
