# Compose Entity: Unlocking Rapid Android Development with Unrivaled Flexibility

**Compose Entity** is an innovative Android development library designed to dramatically streamline your workflow, offering up to **90% code reduction** for data-driven applications built with **Jetpack Compose**.  
But unlike typical code generation tools that often create *"black boxes,"* Compose Entity prioritizes **absolute flexibility and transparency**, putting you firmly in control.

## 🚫 No Black Boxes, Only Transparency

One of the biggest concerns with code generation is the fear of losing control or being locked into rigid structures.  
**Compose Entity completely alleviates this**. The generated code is fully accessible and human-readable. This means you can:

- **Inspect and Understand**  
  Dive into the generated files to see exactly how the UI, ViewModels, Repositories, and DAOs are constructed. This isn't just about using a tool; it's about learning best practices and seeing efficient code in action.

- **Debug with Confidence**  
  Since the code is visible, debugging is straightforward. You're never left guessing what's happening "under the hood."

## 🎛️ Customization & Granular Control: *Your Code, Your Way*

Compose Entity is built with a **tiered generation approach**, giving you unprecedented control over the level of automation:

### ✅ Start Fully Generated

For rapid prototyping or simpler data management screens, let Compose Entity generate everything –  
from your **database DAOs** and **Repositories** to **ViewModels** and a complete **Jetpack Compose UI**.  
This allows you to get a functional screen up and running **in minutes**.

### 🧩 Take Over at Any Level

If the default generated UI or logic doesn't perfectly fit your needs, you can easily *"dial down"* the generation.

- **Choose to generate only** the data layer (*DAO/Repository*), or the data layer plus ViewModels.
- **Copy & Customize UI**:  
  Simply copy the auto-generated UI code from the generated folder into your project. From there, it’s yours to:
  - Modify  
  - Extend  
  - Completely overhaul using standard Jetpack Compose APIs

This provides a powerful starting point without limiting your design freedom.

- **Build Custom Components**:  
  You're never restricted to the generated elements. Seamlessly integrate:
  - Your own custom form elements  
  - Complex layouts  
  - Unique UI components  
  — all directly within the framework’s structure.

> ⚡ **Unrivaled Flexibility**: This granular control means **Compose Entity adapts to your project**, not the other way around.

Whether you need a quick CRUD screen or a highly customized data entry form, Compose Entity provides the foundation, and **you decide how much manual coding is required**.

## 🎨 Effortless UI, Professional by Default

Creating user interfaces can often be a painful and time-consuming process.  
Compose Entity takes the *“pain”* out of UI development by offering:

- **Professional, Ready-to-Use Styling**  
  The generated UI automatically adheres to a **clean, modern, and professional aesthetic**, ensuring your app looks great right out of the box.

- **Automatic Dark/Light Theme Support**  
  Your app’s interface will seamlessly adapt to the user’s preferred theme – no extra effort required.

- **User-Friendly Navigation & Table Controls**  
  Compose Entity provides standardized, intuitive navigation buttons and table management tools that are:
  - Easy to use
  - Familiar to users
  - Time-saving for developers

## 💡 Empowering Developers, Not Replacing Them

Compose Entity isn’t about replacing the developer; it’s about **empowering them** to focus on:

- Unique features  
- Complex business logic  
- Long-term maintainability

...instead of wasting time on repetitive boilerplate.
