# 📦 ComposeEntity — Structure and Philosophy of the Framework

Start fast. See it working. Then scale it to infinite perfection.

ComposeEntity lets you start fast — and scale without limits.
It’s perfect when you want to quickly build and test an idea without wasting time on form design, database wiring, or input handling. With just a few annotations, you get a fully working UI and data layer. And when you're ready to grow, you can customize, extend, or override any part — from field behavior to full-blown logic — all without hitting a wall.

## 🔧 Core Concepts in ComposeEntity

ComposeEntity is built around five primary types of objects:

- 📘 **Directories**  
  Static or semi-static tables, such as products, customers, departments. Usually have unique codes or names.

- 🧾 **Documents**  
  Dynamic records of events — invoices, orders, receipts. Can include tabular parts, timestamps, statuses.

- 📊 **Accumulation Registers**  
  Track balances, turnovers, and aggregates over time. Support dimensions (e.g., owner, date) and resources (e.g., quantity, amount).

- 🧷 **Information Registers**  
  Store time-based or configuration data — settings, histories, references.

- 🧩 **Free Objects**  
  No predefined structure. You can implement any custom logic, form, or data flow manually or partially automated.

## 🛠️ What ComposeEntity Does for You

ComposeEntity handles **all the routine tasks** that developers usually do manually:

- 📂 Automatically builds the entire SQLite database (no need to write Room code)
- 🔁 Manages database migrations (automatically or with warnings)
- 🌐 Generates the full stack:
  `DAO → Repository → ViewModel → UI`  
  — with zero manual boilerplate
- 🎨 Renders edit forms directly from Entity annotations
- 🧠 Adds default UI: buttons, navigation, lists, saving, validation
- 🧩 Allows deep customization of every component (field, behavior, appearance)

## 🔓 Transparency and Full Control

ComposeEntity generates readable code in the `generated` folder — so you can always inspect what's going on under the hood.

- Want to change something? Just copy the generated class and edit it.
- Need complex behavior? Build your own `Composable` or `ViewModel` and plug it in.
- Don't like the default UI? Disable auto-generation for specific objects and build it yourself.

CE never locks you in — it **does everything for you until you want to take over**.

## 🧭 Conceptual Inspiration

ComposeEntity is based on well-established ERP design concepts — long before any particular product existed:

- *master data / transaction documents* → directories and documents
- *dimensions / facts / aggregates* → registers and resources
- *OLAP, Star Schema* → source of multidimensional structures

Systems like SAP, Oracle EBS, and Microsoft Dynamics have long used similar architectural patterns. ComposeEntity does **not copy** any specific platform — instead, it **adapts proven ideas for Android development with Compose**.
