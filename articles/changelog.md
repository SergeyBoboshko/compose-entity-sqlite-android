# Version 1.0.29 - Added

In @CeGenerator annotation:

- Ability to disable the default form caption via the renderCaption boolean flag. When disabled, the standard title/header of the form will not be rendered.
- New overrideable composableTopForm property:  
  Allows injecting a custom @Composable (BaseUI, _BaseFormVM, Form?, String) -> Unit at the top of the form.
  This feature is intended to provide full flexibility for form headers and should be used in place of the default caption.

# Version 1.0.27 ‚Äì Breaking annotation renaming (16.07.2025)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

This version introduces **new, cleaner naming** for all core annotations in the `ComposeEntity` framework.  
Old annotations are now **officially deprecated** and will cause **compilation errors**.

This change improves consistency, clarity, and better reflects the naming style of the framework going forward.

### üîÅ Renamed Annotations

| Old Annotation             | New Annotation            |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| `@ObjectGeneratorCE`       | `@CeGenerator`             |
| `@DatabaseVersion`         | `@CeDatabaseVersion`       |
| `@DatabaseMigration`       | `@CeManualMigration`       |
| `@MigrationEntityCE`       | `@CeMigrationEntity`       |
| `@FormFieldCE`             | `@CeField`                 |
| `@DocumentDescriberCE`     | `@CeDocumentDescriber`     |

### ‚ùó Compilation Errors

If you try to use a deprecated annotation, you will see a **compiler error** like this: Annotation @ObjectGeneratorCE is deprecated. Use @CeGenerator instead.


### ‚úÖ How to Fix

Simply replace all occurrences of deprecated annotations in your code with the corresponding new ones (see the table above).  
No behavioral changes were made ‚Äî only annotation names were updated.

## üÜï New Additions

- Added new official annotations with `Ce*` prefix:  
  - `@CeGenerator`, `@CeField`, `@CeDatabaseVersion`, `@CeManualMigration`, `@CeMigrationEntity`, etc.
- Introduced `@CeFree`, `@CeReport`, `@CeAutoMigration` for advanced use cases.

## üîç Notes

- Deprecated annotations remain in the codebase only to provide meaningful error messages.
- Deprecated annotations will be **fully removed in a future release**.
